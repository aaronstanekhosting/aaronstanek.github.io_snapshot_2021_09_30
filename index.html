    Who am I?
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    I am recent college graduate, scientific researcher, hobbyist programmer and lover of nature.
  </p>
  <p class="section">
    What did I do at school?
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    I just got a BS in physics from <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">UC Santa Barbara</a>.
    While there, I was part of the <a href="https://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">College of Creative Studies</a> (CCS),
    a school within the university focused stimulating original work and engaging students in real-world scientific research.
    For me, this meant a crash course in physics from day one, most notably including an advanced lab class sequence during my second year,
    and access to some upper division coursework well ahead of my peers outside CCS.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    Even though my background is in physics, I certainly don't limit myself to just physics.
    I'm always eager to branch out and try new things.
    For example, I teamed up with the <a href="https://datascienceucsb.org/" target="_blank">UCSB Data Science Club</a>
    to figure out what makes some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> listings successful, and others not.
  </p>
  <p class="section">
    What do I research?
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    Currently, I am working as an intern at <a href="https://www.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">Lawrence Berkeley Lab</a> with
    <a href="http://www-rnc.lbl.gov/~spencer/" target="_blank">Dr. Spencer Klein</a>.
    My work currently centers around building a model of backward vector meson production
    in ultra-peripheral collisions.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    While at UC Santa Barbara,
    I worked in the lab of <a href="http://stuart.physics.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. David Stuart</a>.
    Most of the work in the lab is centered about the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04669.pdf" target="_blank">milliQan Experiment</a>,
    a search for milli-charged particles in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider" target="_blank">LHC</a>,
    created from proton-proton collisions. This experiment is part of a larger search for
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, physics beyond the standard model.
    My part in milliQan has varied over time; recently most of my time in the lab was spent around my own project.
    Over about two years, I developed a lab class experiment to teach undergraduate physics majors
    about techniques in particles physics including particle detector function, gamma-ray spectroscopy, Compton Scattering, and data analysis.
    For this, I designed the physical apparatus, the experimental procedure, and the analysis software.
    I used a 3D printer to build most of the setup, and a soldering iron to build the electronic components.

    If you are curious about all the other things happening in Dr. Stuart's lab, we keep an active online journal of all of our activities.

  <p class="section">
    What do I code?
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    Short answer: Nothing spectacular.
    Long answer: I mess around, see what I can build. Mostly small widgets and tools, some are larger projects.

    Recently, I made <a href="coins" target="_blank">a calculator to estimate the value of spare change</a>.

    What do I do in nature?
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    Hiking, biking, camping, SCUBA diving, tidepooling, or just a stroll through the park.
    I enjoy being in and around nature. I like sharing nature with others.
    I am firmly believe that we need to protect what is here and restore what is lost
    to share with future gnerations that which we have today.

    Am I a competent adult?

    Somewhat. Please see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amstanek/" target="_blank">my LinkedIn page</a>
