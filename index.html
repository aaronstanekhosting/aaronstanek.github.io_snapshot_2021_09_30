    Who am I?
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    I am an undergraduate physics major, student researcher, and hobbyist programmer.
  </p>
  <p class="section">
    What do I do at school?
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    Currently, I am working through my final year at <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">UC Santa Barbara</a>,
    where I am enrolled in the <a href="https://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">College of Creative Studies</a> (CCS).
    CCS is a small college set up to serve as an graduate school for undergraduates; the students work in small classroom
    settings with their peers and professors to explore knowledge at an accelerated pace.
    For me, this meant a crash course in physics from day one, most notably including an advanced lab class sequence during my second year,
    and access to some upper division coursework well ahead of my peers outside CCS.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    Even though my background is in physics, I certainly don't limit myself to just physics.
    I'm always eager to branch out and try new things.
    For example, I've recently teamed up with the <a href="https://datascienceucsb.org/" target="_blank">UCSB Data Science Club</a>
    to figure out what makes some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> listings successful, and others not.
  </p>
  <p class="section">
    What do I research?
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    I work in the lab of <a href="http://stuart.physics.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. David Stuart</a> at UC Santa Barbara.
    Most of the work in the lab is centered about the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04669.pdf" target="_blank">milliQan Experiment</a>,
    a search for milli-charged particles in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider" target="_blank">LHC</a>,
    created from proton-proton collisions. This experiment is part of a larger search for
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, physics beyond the standard model.
    My part in milliQan has varied over time; most of my efforts have been spent on my own project within the lab.
    Over the last year, I have developed a lab class experiment to teach undergraduate physics majors
    about techniques in particles physics including particle detector function, gamma-ray spectroscopy, Compton Scattering, and data analysis.
    For this, I designed the physical apparatus, the experimental procedure, and the analysis software.
    I used a 3D printer to build most of the setup, and a soldering iron to build the electronic components.

    We are currently conducting a trial run of these detectors in an upper division physics lab class.
    If this trial is successful, the detectors and the experiments that go along with them could become part of the class' regular curriculum.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    If you are curious about all the other things happening in Dr. Stuart's lab, we keep an active online journal of all of our activities.

  <p class="section">
    What do I code?
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    Short answer: Nothing spectacular.
    Long answer: I mess around, see what I can build. Mostly small widgets and tools, some are larger projects.
